# PeerPrep - Matching Service

This repository contains the backend microservice responsible for matching users in the PeerPrep application. It provides a robust, scalable system for queueing users based on their preferred question topic and difficulty, finding suitable partners, and handling timeouts gracefully.

The service is built with TypeScript, Node.js, and Express, and it leverages Redis for high-speed queue management and RabbitMQ for an efficient, event-driven timeout mechanism.

## Architecture Overview

The Matching Service is designed as a standalone microservice that interacts with other services within the PeerPrep ecosystem.

- **Web Server (Express.js)**: Provides a versioned RESTful API for clients to interact with the service.

- **Queue Management (Redis)**: Uses Redis Lists to maintain a separate FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue for each question topic. This ensures that matching is both fast and fair. Optimized with SCAN operations for production-safe performance.

- **Timeout Handling (RabbitMQ)**: Implements an event-driven timeout system using a Time-To-Live (TTL) and Dead-Letter Exchange pattern in RabbitMQ. This is highly efficient and avoids the need for constant database polling.

- **Input Validation (Zod)**: Comprehensive schema validation using Zod library ensures type-safe request handling and proper error responses for invalid inputs.

- **Authentication Integration**: Integrates with User Service for JWT token validation, providing secure access control while delegating all authentication logic to the centralized user service.

- **Controller/Service Pattern**: The code is structured to separate API routing and request handling (Controllers) from the core business logic (Services), making the application clean and maintainable.

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes, axios-specific error handling, and graceful service degradation.

## Key Features

### Core Matching Features
- **Criteria-Based Matching**: Matches users who have selected the same question topic and difficulty.
- **FIFO Queues**: Ensures that users who have been waiting the longest are the first to be matched.
- **Priority Re-queuing**: Disconnected users are added to the front of the queue for faster re-matching.
- **Atomic Operations**: Race condition prevention through Redis atomic operations.

### Real-time Features
- **Status Polling**: Allows clients to check the status of a pending match request (pending, success, or not_found).
- **Event-Driven Timeouts**: Automatically removes users from the queue after a 2-minute waiting period using a non-blocking RabbitMQ implementation.
- **Instant Matching**: When a suitable partner is found immediately, creates a collaboration session instantly.

### Security & Reliability
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token validation through User Service integration with simple boolean response checking.
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation using Zod schemas with proper error messages.
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own match data through authenticated endpoints.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript and Zod ensure type-safe operations throughout the service.
- **Service Communication**: Integrates with Collaboration Service to create coding sessions.
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically re-queues both users if collaboration session creation fails.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles downstream service failures appropriately.

### Operational Features
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.
- **Cancellation Support**: Allows users to cancel their pending match request.
- **Scalable Design**: Stateless architecture suitable for horizontal scaling.

### Data Structures
```typescript
interface QueueEntry {
  userId: string;
  difficulty: string;    // "Easy" | "Medium" | "Hard"
  timestamp: number;     // Unix timestamp
}

// Supported Topics (validated by Zod schema)
type Topic = "Arrays" | "Strings" | "Graphs" | "Trees" | "Dynamic Programming" | 
             "Sorting" | "Searching" | "Recursion" | "Greedy" | "Backtracking";

// Supported Difficulties (validated by Zod schema)  
type Difficulty = "Easy" | "Medium" | "Hard";
```

### Queue Management
- **Topic-Based Queues**: Separate Redis lists for each coding topic (Arrays, Graphs, etc.)
- **FIFO Processing**: First-come, first-served matching within each topic
- **Difficulty Filtering**: Only matches users with identical difficulty preferences
- **Status Tracking**: Redis-based user status management (pending/success/not_found)

### Timeout System
- **TTL Pattern**: Uses RabbitMQ TTL + Dead Letter Exchange (no plugin dependencies)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes expired users from all queues after 2 minutes
- **Status Verification**: Only removes users still in "pending" state
- **Event-Driven**: Non-blocking, horizontally scalable design

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1/matching` and **require authentication** via JWT tokens validated by the User Service.

### Create Match Request
**POST** `/requests`

Adds a user to the matchmaking queue. User ID is extracted from the validated JWT token.

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "topic": "Arrays"
}
```

**Validation Rules:**
- `difficulty`: Must be one of "Easy", "Medium", "Hard"  
- `topic`: Must be one of the supported topics (Arrays, Strings, Graphs, etc.)
- Authentication token must be valid and match a user in the system

**Responses:**

**200 OK (Match Found):**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Match found!",
  "sessionId": "session-1728650460000",
  "matchedWith": "user456"
}
```

**202 Accepted (Added to Queue):**
```json
{
  "status": "pending",
  "message": "No match found at this time. You have been added to the queue."
}
```

**400 Bad Request (Validation Error):**
```json
{
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "difficulty", 
      "message": "Invalid enum value. Expected 'Easy' | 'Medium' | 'Hard', received 'easy'"
    }
  ]

## Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Redis (for queue management)
- RabbitMQ (for timeout handling)
- User Service (for JWT authentication validation)

### Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a file named `.env` in the root of the matching_service directory and add the following configuration:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
   RABBITMQ_URL="amqp://localhost"
   COLLABORATION_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:3001/api/v1/collaborations"
   USER_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:4001"
   ```

### Running the Service

1. **Start Redis:**
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

2. **Start RabbitMQ:**
   
   If you installed with Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew services start rabbitmq
   ```
   
   If you are using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name some-rabbit -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
   ```

3. **Start the User Service** (required for authentication):
   ```bash
   # Navigate to user_service directory and start it
   cd ../user_service && npm run dev
   ```

4. **Start the Matching Service:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The service will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing the API

### Authentication Required
All API endpoints require a valid JWT token. First, obtain a token from the User Service:

```bash
# 1. Register a user (via User Service)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4001/api/v1/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123", "username": "testuser"}'

# 2. Login to get JWT token (via User Service)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4001/api/v1/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
```

### Testing Endpoints

```bash
# Create a match request (replace YOUR_JWT_TOKEN with actual token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/matching/requests \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"difficulty": "Easy", "topic": "Arrays"}'

# Check match status
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/matching/requests/YOUR_USER_ID/status \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Cancel match request
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/v1/matching/requests \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"topic": "Arrays"}'

# Test without authentication (should return 401)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/matching/requests \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"difficulty": "Easy", "topic": "Arrays"}'
```

## Error Handling

The service implements comprehensive error handling:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data or validation failures
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid, expired, or missing JWT token
- **403 Forbidden**: User trying to access another user's data
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Service errors with detailed logging
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Downstream service failures (User Service, Collaboration Service)

## Production Considerations

### Performance
- **Redis Optimization**: Uses SCAN operations instead of blocking KEYS commands for production safety
- **Non-blocking Operations**: All Redis operations are designed to avoid blocking the event loop
- **Efficient Queue Access**: Targeted queue operations with minimal Redis overhead

### Scalability
- **Stateless Design**: Supports horizontal scaling with load balancers
- **Redis Clustering**: Compatible with Redis cluster setups
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: RabbitMQ enables distributed processing

### Monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logs with service prefixes
- **Health Checks**: Root endpoint for service health verification
- **Queue Utilities**: Built-in functions for monitoring queue status and debugging

### Security
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token validation through User Service integration
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own match data and status
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation using Zod schemas
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime type errors
- **Service Communication**: Authenticated inter-service communication
